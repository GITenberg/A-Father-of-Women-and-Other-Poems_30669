<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our father
works in us,<br />
The daughters of his manhood.&nbsp; Not undone<br />
Is he, not wasted, though transmuted thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though he left no son.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore
on him I cry<br />
To arm me: &ldquo;For my delicate mind a casque,<br />
A breastplate for my heart, courage to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thee, captain, I ask.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nor
strengthen only; press<br />
A finger on this violent blood and pale,<br />
Over this rash will let thy tenderness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A while pause, and prevail.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And
shepherd-father, thou<br />
Whose staff folded my thoughts before my birth,<br />
Control them now I am of earth, and now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art no more of earth.</p>

Crush in my nature the ungenerous art<br />
Of the inferior; set me high, and here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here garner up thy
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to him
now are they,<br />
The million living fathers of the War&mdash;<br />
Mourning the crippled world, the bitter day&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose striplings are no more.</p>

<span class="smcap">to the early dead in battle</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no
length of days<br />
But yours, boys who were children once.&nbsp; Of old<br />
The past beset you in your childish ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sense of Time untold!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have
you then forgone?<br />
A history?&nbsp; This you had.&nbsp; Or memories?<br />
These, too, you had of your far-distant dawn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No further dawn seems his,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man
who shares with you,<br />
But has no more, no more.&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s mystery<br />
Did once for him the most that it can do:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has had infancy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his
dreams, and all<br />
His loves for mighty Nature, sweet and few,<br />
Are but the dwindling past he can recall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of what his childhood knew.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He counts
not any more<br />
His brief, his present years.&nbsp; But O he knows<br />
How far apart the summers were of yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How far apart the snows.</p>

Long life is in your treasury ere you fall;<br />
Yes, and first love, like Dante&rsquo;s.&nbsp; O a bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever mystical!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrevocable
good,&mdash;<br />
You dead, and now about, so young, to die,&mdash;<br />

11</span>NURSE EDITH CAVELL</h2>
<p>Two o&rsquo;clock, the morning of October 12th, 1915.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her
accustomed eyes<br />
The midnight-morning brought not such a dread<br />
As thrills the chance-awakened head that lies<br />
In trivial sleep on the habitual bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas
yet some hours ere light;<br />
And many, many, many a break of day<br />
Had she outwatched the dying; but this night<br />
Shortened her vigil was, briefer the way.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By dial of
the clock<br />
&rsquo;Twas day in the dark above her lonely head.<br />
&ldquo;This day thou shalt be with Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ere the
cock<br />
Announced that day she met the Immortal Dead.</p>

12</span>SUMMER IN ENGLAND, 1914</h2>
<p class="poetry">On London fell a clearer light;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caressing pencils of the sun<br />
Defined the distances, the white<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Houses transfigured one by one,<br />
The &ldquo;long, unlovely street&rdquo; impearled.<br />
O what a sky has walked the world!</p>
<p class="poetry">Most happy year!&nbsp; And out of town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hay was prosperous, and the wheat;<br />
The silken harvest climbed the down;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon after moon was heavenly-sweet<br />
Stroking the bread within the sheaves,<br />
Looking twixt apples and their leaves.</p>
<p class="poetry">And while this rose made round her cup,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The armies died convulsed.&nbsp; And when<br />
This chaste young silver sun went up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Softly, a thousand shattered men,<br />
One wet corruption, heaped the plain,<br />
After a league-long throb of pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Flower following tender flower; and birds,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And berries; and benignant skies<br />
Made thrive the serried flocks and herds.&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yonder are men shot through the eyes.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love, hide thy face<br />
From man&rsquo;s unpardonable race.</p>

<p class="poetry">Who said &ldquo;No man hath greater love than
this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To die to serve his friend?&rdquo;<br />
So these have loved us all unto the end.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chide thou no more, O thou unsacrificed!<br />
The soldier dying dies upon a kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very kiss of Christ.</p>

14</span>TO TINTORETTO IN VENICE</h2>
<p><i>The Art of Painting had in the Primitive years looked with
the light</i>, <i>not towards it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Before
Tintoretto&rsquo;s date</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>many painters
practised shadows and lights</i>, <i>and turned more or less
sunwards</i>; <i>but he set the figure between himself and a full
sun</i>.&nbsp; <i>His work is to be known in Venice by the
splendid trick of an occluded sun and a shadow thrown straight at
the spectator</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tintoretto&rsquo;s thronged</i> &ldquo;<i>Procession to
Calvary</i>&rdquo; <i>and his</i>
&ldquo;<i>Crucifixion</i>,&rdquo; <i>incidentally named</i>,
<i>are two of the greatest of his multitude of works in
Venice</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master, thy
enterprise,<br />
Magnificent, magnanimous, was well done,<br />
Which seized, the head of Art, and turned her eyes&mdash;<br />
The simpleton&mdash;and made her front the sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long had
she sat content,<br />
Her young unlessoned back to a morning gay,<br />
To a solemn noon, to a cloudy firmament,<br />
And looked upon a world in gentle day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thy
imperial call<br />
Bade her to stand with thee and breast the light,<br />
And therefore face the shadows, mystical,<br />
Sombre, translucent, vestiges of night,</p>

Sky-ward, and by thy glooms; we blow thy way<br />
Ambiguous, and those halo-misted dyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou Cloud,
the bridegroom&rsquo;s friend<br />
(The bridegroom sun)!&nbsp; Master, we know thy sign:<br />
A mystery of hues world-without-end;<br />
And hide-and-seek of gamesome and divine;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shade of
the noble head<br />
Cast hitherward upon the noble breast;<br />
Human solemnities thrice hallow&egrave;d;<br />
The haste to Calvary, the Cross at rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look
sunward, Angel, then!<br />
Carry the fortress-heavens by that hand;<br />

16</span>A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN</h2>
<p class="poetry">A voice peals in this end of night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A phrase of notes resembling stars,<br />
Single and spiritual notes of light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What call they at my window-bars?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The South, the past, the day to
be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ancient infelicity.</p>
<p class="poetry">Darkling, deliberate, what sings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This wonderful one, alone, at peace?<br />
What wilder things than song, what things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeter than youth, clearer than Greece,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dearer than Italy, untold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delight, and freshness centuries
old?</p>
<p class="poetry">And first first-loves, a multitude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The exaltation of their pain;<br />
Ancestral childhood long renewed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And midnights of invisible rain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gardens, gardens, night and
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardens and childhood all the
way.</p>
<p class="poetry">What Middle Ages passionate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O passionless voice!&nbsp; What distant bells<br />
Lodged in the hills, what palace state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Illyrian!&nbsp; For it speaks, it tells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without desire, without dismay,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some morrow and some
yesterday.</p>

thine, than thine,<br />

Seem to be clasped and harboured within mine.<br />
O how ignoble this my clasp appears!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy
unprophetic birth,<br />
Thy darkling death: living I might have seen<br />
That cradle, marked those labours, closed that earth.<br />
O first, O last, O infinite between!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that my
life has shared<br />
Thy dedicated date, O mortal, twice,<br />

arms that fold<br />
A poet to a foolish breast?&nbsp; The Line,<br />
That is not, with the world within its hold?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath alien clusters of the nights,<br />
Looked, in the past, such eyes as these?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-quenched, relumed, ancestral lights!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And steadfast Nature, secretwise&mdash;<br />
Thou seedling child of that old stem&mdash;<br />

Occluded by grey eyes and blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Nature feigning to forget?</p>
<p class="poetry">Some grandam gave a hint of it&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So cherished was it in thy race,<br />
So fine a treasure to transmit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In its perfection to thy face.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some father to some mother&rsquo;s breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrusted it, unknowing.&nbsp; Time<br />
Implied, or made it manifest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bequest of a forgotten clime.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hereditary eyes!&nbsp; But this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is single, singular, apart:&mdash; <br />
New-made thy love, new-made thy kiss,<br />

20</span>THE TREASURE</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times
have I beheld<br />
Fear leap in a babe&rsquo;s face, and take his breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear, like the fear of eld<br />
That knows the price of life, the name of death.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it
justifies<br />
This thing, this dread, this fright that has no tongue,<br />

When only eyes can speak&mdash;they are so young?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet
those eyes had wept.<br />
What does fear cherish that it locks so well?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What fortress is thus kept?<br />
Of what is ignorant terror sentinel?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pain in
the poor child,<br />
Monstrously disproportionate, and dumb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the poor beast, and wild<br />
In the old decorous man, caught, overcome?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what the
outposts these?<br />
Of what the fighting guardians?&nbsp; What demands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sense of menaces,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Has crossed the English land to-day<br />
With an unprecedented kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wonderfully found a way!</p>
<p class="poetry">Unsmirched incredibly and clean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the towns and factories,<br />
Avoiding, has his long flight been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing a sky like Sicily&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="poetry">Most like a man in man&rsquo;s own day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the few, a perfect one:<br />
His open earth&mdash;the single way;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His narrow road&mdash;the open sun.</p>

23</span>IN SLEEP</h2>
<p class="poetry">I dreamt (no &ldquo;dream&rdquo; awake&mdash;a
dream indeed)<br />
A wrathful man was talking in the park:<br />
&ldquo;Where are the Higher Powers, who know our need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave us in
the dark?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;There are no Higher Powers; there is no
heart<br />
In God, no love&rdquo;&mdash;his oratory here,<br />
Taking the paupers&rsquo; and the cripples&rsquo; part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was broken by a
tear.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then it seemed that One who did create<br
/>
Compassion, who alone invented pity,<br />
Walked, as though called, in at that north-east gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out from the
muttering city;</p>
<p class="poetry">Threaded the little crowd, trod the brown
grass,<br />
Bent o&rsquo;er the speaker close, saw the tear rise,<br />
And saw Himself, as one looks in a glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those
impassioned eyes.</p>

24</span>THE DIVINE PRIVILEGE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Lord, where are Thy prerogatives?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, men have more than Thou hast kept;<br />
The king rewards, remits, forgives,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet to a throne has stept.</p>
<p class="poetry">And Thou, despoiled, hast given away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Worship to men, success to strife,<br />
Thy glory to the heavenly day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made Thy sun the lord of life.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is one too precious to impart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One property reserved to Christ?<br />
One, cherished, grappled to that heart?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;To be alone the Sacrificed?</p>
<p class="poetry">O Thou who lovest to redeem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One whom I know lies sore oppressed.<br />
Thou wilt not suffer me to dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I can bargain for her rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Seven hours I swiftly sleep, while she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures the leagues of dark, awake.<br />
O that my dewy eyes might be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Parched by a vigil for her sake!</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul has sealed in silence; past delights,<br />
Hope unconfessed; desires with hampered wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembered in the nights.</p>
<p class="poetry">But my best treasures are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoble, undelightful, abject, cold;<br />
Yet O! profounder hoards oracular<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No reliquaries hold.</p>
<p class="poetry">There lie my trespasses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Abjured but not disowned.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
accuse<br />
Determinism, nor, as the Master <a name="citation26"></a><a

&nbsp;&nbsp; Charge even &ldquo;the poor Deuce.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Under my hand they lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My very own, my proved iniquities,<br />
And though the glory of my life go by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hold and garner these.</p>
<p class="poetry">How else, how otherwhere.<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
